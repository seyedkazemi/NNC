# NNC
Datasets:
ARAS (Real-world data sets for Activity Recognition with Ambient Sensing)
http://aras.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/

from ARAS datasets Selected House A


Pay Attention:
           To use this code, the reading part of the datasets must be changed

DATASETS :
           Change to CSV format 
           Add a row (first row) for the sensor name and resident number (In short)
           Add a column to show the seconds.

Anomaly state is checked for resident 1 in House A
We divided the datasets into two equal parts
We used all the second 15 days of the datasets in  to check for anomalies
You can change this division
The first 15 days (two weeks) are used for the initial learning of the algorithm.
from the sixteenth day, NNC begins to be calculated.
